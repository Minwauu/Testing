# Testing

- Testing is checking that a program should work as intended.

- Unit Testing is testing small subsections of code - software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually scrutinized for proper operation.

- Confirmation bias is a type of mistake that occurs in thinking when information that confirms a pre-existing belief is given priority over information that does not support a preexisting belief i.e believing your code has something already and searching for it.

  Stages of testing:
  - Module
  - Program
  - System

### Testing Plan 

A good way to structure your testing is to create a test plan. A test plan is usually a table that contains the following information:

A unique ID for each test
A description of each test, explaining which part of the system is to be tested
The test data that is to be used for each test (e.g. data entered by the user, actions performed by the user, etc.)
A description of the expected results of each test
